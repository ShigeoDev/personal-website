summary: 'thoughts about deploying my first website, my coding journey up to now, and what i will do in the future'

Yay!!!! I am excited to be writing my first blog and even more excited to be deploying my first website. I just finished my first year in university, and have been working through The Odin Project this summer. Javascript is a bit of an odd language, the arrow functions and array methods are interesting but kinda cool to use. However, it is extremely rewarding to finally start working on this project.

## for now

My website right now isn't the greatest. Currently, I am just using a NextJS template and I plan on moving on from it when my React skills improve. I don't exactly have a vision for it, however I would like to make it very dynamic and eye catching. I will be on the hunt for inspiration for my websites.

## the future

I would like to be a full stack engineer by the end of this year, and hopefully build a SAAS (no matter how bad). However, with the upcoming school year, I don't know how the timeline for that will play out. All in all, I just want to keep learning and improving my stack.
